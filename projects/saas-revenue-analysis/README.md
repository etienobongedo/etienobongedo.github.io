Analyzed a dataset of **2,000+ customer records** for a SaaS business to uncover revenue trends, identify upsell opportunities, forecast sales, and model growth scenarios—providing actionable insights to drive business decisions.

## Key Deliverables & Impact:

### 1. Revenue Trend Analysis

Tracked **$693K in sales** across subscription tiers (Basic, Premium, Business, Enterprise) over 2 years.

Identified **Enterprise plans as the top revenue driver** (41% of total sales), with 56% **YoY growth** in Premium tier sales.

### 2. Upsell Opportunity Modeling

Quantified **$15.9K in potential monthly revenue** by converting non-paying users, with a **50% conversion rate for Basic tier users** (highest ROI).

Prioritized accounts for upsell campaigns using metrics like contract length, active users, and historical spend.

### 3. Growth Scenario Planning

Determined a **24% growth rate** was needed to hit **$100K monthly sales** (Goal Seek analysis).

Modeled **price elasticity** for Premium plans, revealing optimal pricing between **$20–$25/license** to maximize revenue without churn.

### 4. Forecasting & Confidence Intervals

Projected future sales (Jul 2021–Jun 2022) using **90% and 95% confidence intervals**, enabling data-driven budget planning.

## Tools & Techniques:

**Pivot Tables** (Bucketed revenue trends by tier/month).

**Scenario Analysis** (Goal Seek, Elasticity Modeling, Data Tables).

**Forecasting** (Time-series with CI bounds).

## Why This Matters:
This project demonstrates **end-to-end data-driven decision-making**—from cleaning raw subscription data to delivering strategic recommendations that directly impact revenue growth.
